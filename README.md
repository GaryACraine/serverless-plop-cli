# serverless-plop-cli

This article covers using the Plop framework to create a CLI which can auto generate our scaffolded serverless code; with code examples written in TypeScript and the AWSÂ CDK.

## Getting started

Let's start by installing this local package as if it is a npm package:

1. change directory into the advocate-cli folder

```
cd into advocate-cli
```

2. link this in dev mode like a global package

```
npm link
```
