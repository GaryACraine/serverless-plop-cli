# Serverless Plop CLI

This article covers using the Plop framework to create a basic CLI which can auto generate our scaffolded serverless code using the clean code lightweight approach; with code examples written in TypeScript and the AWSÂ CDK.

**NOTE: This is a basic example of the CLI to show the templating approach with Plop - this is not production ready.**

## Getting started

Let's start by installing this local package as if it is a npm package:

1. change directory into the advocate-cli folder

```
cd into advocate-cli
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

3. build the CLI and link this in dev mode like a global package

```
npm run build && npm run link
```

To run the solution please look at the steps in the article linked above.
